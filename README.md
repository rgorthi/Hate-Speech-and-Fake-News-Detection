# Hate-Speech-and-Fake-News-Detection
Hate speech is commonly defined as any communication that
belittles a target group of people based on some characteristic
such as colour, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation,
nationality, religion, race, or other characteristic. Due to the
massive rise of user-created web content on social media, the
numbers of hate speech is also steadily increasing. Over the
past years, interest in online hate speech detection and,
particularly, the automation of this task has continuously
grown, along with the societal impact of the incident. This
paper describes a hate speech classification model based on
Distil-BERT.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media has become a
home ground for false information. An example of its
influence can be found in the fake-news outbreak that
followed the COVID-19 pandemic and the events that Infected
thus. To tackle this infodemic, scientific oversight, as well as a
proper understanding by practitioners in crisis management,
is needed. This paper describes a fake news classification
model based on GloVe embeddings for feature extraction
followed by training an LSTM model.
